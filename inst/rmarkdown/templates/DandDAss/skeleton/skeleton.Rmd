<!-- This is a template R markdown file for D&D Assignments.  

This part is a text comment that will not show up in the final Word document.  

The first chunk of R code below sets up R markdown so that the code will be displayed in the final word document alongside its output.  Feel free to delete this comment but do not delete the first chunk of R code. -->

# R Markdown (Top Level Heading)

This is an R Markdown document for D&D Assignments.  R markdown is a simple way of creating nice looking MS Word documents that contain "chunks" of R code alongside their associated output. See the handy reference sheet for R markdown in RStudio at Help > Markdown Quick Reference.

## Running code (Second Level Heading)
You can run your code one chunk at a time by clicking the play button at the top right of each chunk.  You can run all chunks by clicking the Run button, and then "Run All" (shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+R).

## Creating your Word document
Click the **Knit** button to create a Word document that includes both the text content and also the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

### Embedding R code (Third Level Heading)
You can embed an R code chunk in two ways.  (1) you can create a chunk manually by either typing out or copying and pasting the chunk below. (2) You can hit the green button at the top right of this document that has a C (for "code") on it and a plus sign, then hit R.

```{r}

# [Your code goes here -- this is just an R comment so it does nothing.]
